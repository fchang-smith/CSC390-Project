This GPT uses the OpenWeather API to fetch current weather data based on the city names you provide. No personal data is stored, processed, or shared by this GPT beyond the necessary API requests to OpenWeather. Your inputs (e.g., city names) are only used to retrieve the requested weather information.

This GPT does not store, log, or analyze any of your queries or data. All requests are processed in real-time and discarded afterward. Please refer to OpenWeather's Privacy Policy for details on how their API handles request data.
